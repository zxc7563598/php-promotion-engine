A **flexible and scalable** PHP promotional strategy engine that enables various complex promotional logics (money off, discounts, tiered offers, member discounts, etc.) in shopping carts to be implemented more elegantly and maintainably.

## 🚀 Usage

```php
use Hejunjie\PromotionEngine\Models\Cart;
use Hejunjie\PromotionEngine\Models\User;
use Hejunjie\PromotionEngine\PromotionEngine;
use Hejunjie\PromotionEngine\Rules;

// Create user (VIP)
$user = new User(vip: true);

// Create a shopping cart (with 10 items, and the total price can cover various rules)
$cart = new Cart();
$cart->addItem('商品A', 50, 1, ['snacks']);
$cart->addItem('商品B', 60, 1, ['clothes']);
$cart->addItem('商品C', 40, 1, ['clothes']);
$cart->addItem('商品D', 100, 1, ['promo']);
$cart->addItem('商品E', 30, 3, ['snacks']);
$cart->addItem('商品F', 200, 1, ['electronics']);

// Initialize the promotion engine
$engine = new PromotionEngine();
// Explanation of promotion calculation mode:
//
// independent (independent mode):
// Each rule calculates the discount amount separately based on the "original price of the product",
// Finally, the discounts will be consolidated, and the total price will not be affected by intermediate calculations from other rules.
//
// sequential (discount-on-discount mode):
// Each rule continues to calculate based on the "previously calculated price", resulting in a "discount on discount" effect.
// When a rule involves multiple products, the discount amount will be allocated based on the proportion of each product's original price in the total combined price,
// To ensure that the price of each item is updated correctly in subsequent calculations.
//
// lock (locked mode):
// Each item will only be discounted by one rule at most, and subsequent rules will not apply repeated discounts to items that have already been locked.
// Applicable to business scenarios where "a certain product can only enjoy one discount" (such as flash sales, exclusive coupons, etc.).
$engine->setMode('independent');

// Register all rules
$engine->addRule(new Rules\FullDiscountRule(200, 0.9));  // 10% off for purchases over 200
$engine->addRule(new Rules\FullQuantityReductionRule(3, 20));  // Buy 3 or more and get 20% off
$engine->addRule(new Rules\NthItemDiscountRule(3, 0.5));  // Third item is 50% off
$engine->addRule(new Rules\VipDiscountRule(0.95));  // 5% discount for VIP
$engine->addRule(new Rules\FullQuantityDiscountRule(5, 0.9));  // 10% off for purchases of 5 items or more
$engine->addRule(new Rules\FullReductionRule(100, 20));  // 20 off for purchases over 100
$engine->addRule(new Rules\VipReductionRule(5));  // VIP: 5 yuan off

// Perform calculation
$result = $engine->calculate($cart, $user);

// Print result (for manual verification)
echo "\n=== test result ===\n";
echo "original price: ¥{$result['original']}\n";
echo "discount: -¥{$result['discount']}\n";
echo "final: ¥{$result['final']}\n";
echo "Discount Details:\n";
foreach ($result['details'] as $detail) {
    echo "- {$detail}\n";
}

// 输出内容：
// === test result ===
// original price: ¥540
// discount: -¥200
// final: ¥340
// Discount Details:
// - 指定商品满200元打0.9折 (-¥54)
// - 指定商品满3件减20 (-¥20)
// - 指定商品第3件打5折 (-¥20)
// - VIP 0.95 折 (-¥27)
// - 指定商品满5件打9折 (-¥54)
// - 指定商品满100减20 (-¥20)
// - VIP 立减 5 元 (-¥5)

## 🛠️ Rule type (out-of-box)

| 方法 | 说明 |

| NthItemDiscountRule | The Nth item is discounted by Z (Example: the 3rd item is discounted by 50%) | 
| TieredDiscountRule | Enjoy a Z% discount when your purchase reaches X yuan (Example: 10% discount when your purchase reaches 100 yuan, 20% discount when your purchase reaches 200 yuan, 30% discount when your purchase reaches 500 yuan (whichever is the highest)) | 
| VipDiscountRule | VIP users enjoy discounts (Example: 10% off for VIP) | 
| FullQuantityDiscountRule | Buy X items and get Z% off (Example: Buy 3 items and get 10% off) |

## 🎯 Purpose & Original Intent

> **Why write this package?**

In e-commerce, B2C, and retail systems, promotion logic is often scattered across Controller, Service, and if-else statements. Once there are numerous rules, maintenance becomes a nightmare.

✅ I hope to **solve this problem using a 'rule engine + extensible policy class'**:

- **Write each discount as a separate class** → clear, easy to test, reusable
- **Supports multiple calculation modes** → `original` (based on original price) / `stack` (discount on discount)
- **Easy to extend** → Adding new rules only requires `extends PromotionRule`

👉 In this way, for future integrations of **new activities / membership levels / specific product category discounts**, it will only be necessary to create a new `Rule`, without the need for major code modifications.
